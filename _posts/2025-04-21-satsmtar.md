    SAT/SMT/AR 2025: International Summer School on Satisfiability, Satisfiability Modulo Theories, and Automated Reasoning
    Dates: August 6–8, 2025
    Location: University of St Andrews, Scotland

Satisfiability (SAT), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and Automated Reasoning (AR) continue to make rapid advances and find novel uses across computer science and beyond. Similarly to previous years, the SAT/SMT/AR Summer School will bring a select group of participants (PhD students, Master students, and practitioners) up to speed in this vibrant research area. No prior SAT/SMT/AR expertise is required, though a background in logic, problem‑solving, programming and mathematics will help you get the most out of the school.

### What’s confirmed

- Dates & venue: August 6–8, North Haugh campus, St Andrews, Scotland
- Format: Mix of lectures, hands‑on practicals, and informal Q&A
- Participants: 50, selected from all qualified applicants
