The Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen (DIKU) invites applications from professors at all levels within all areas of computer science to join our department! Needless to say, the Algorithms and Complexity Section would particularly welcome strong applicants in algorithms, complexity theory, and automated reasoning to strengthen and expand our world-leading research environment.

DIKU hosts the Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen centre ([BARC](https://barc.ku.dk/)) joint with the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU), and we also have extensive collaborations with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and with Lund University on the Swedish side of the Oresund Bridge, as well as with our many visitors. We aim to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious, creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in algorithms and complexity theory. While the focus in on foundational research, we do have a track record of surprising algorithmic discoveries leading to major industrial applications.

The application deadline is September 1, 2024. See [the announcement](https://di.ku.dk/english/about/vacancies/tenure-track-assistant-associate-or-full-professor-in-computer-science/) for more information including instructions how to apply. Please do not hesitate to contact Mikkel Thorup at `mthorup@di.ku.dk` or Jakob Nordström at `jn@di.ku.dk` if you are interested in learning more about this or other opportunities to join one of the most exciting and dynamic environments in foundational computer science in Europe!
