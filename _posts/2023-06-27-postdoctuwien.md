There is an opening for a postdoc position ("university assistant") at TU Wien within the Algorithms and Complexity research unit. Candidates should have a research focus on quantified propositional logic (quantified and dependency quantified Boolean formulas), including practical aspects (solver development, engineering, applications) and theory (proof complexity). Candidates should have a strong publication track record on that research topic and excellent written and oral communication skills. Since the position includes undergraduate teaching, knowledge of German (level B2) or willingness to learn it in the first year is required. The position is limited to 6 years for 40 hours/week with an expected start in September 2023. The deadline for applications is June 17, 2023.
