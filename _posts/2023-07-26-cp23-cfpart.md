    Twenty-Ninth Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming
    CP 2023 (https://cp2023.a4cp.org)

    August 27-31, 2023, Toronto, Canada

CP is the premier international event for presenting research in all
aspects of computing with constraints, including, but not restricted to:
theory, algorithms, environments, languages, models, systems,
and applications. [CP 2023](https://cp2023.a4cp.org/index.html) will be held *in-person* in Toronto at the
[University of Toronto St. George campus (Downtown)](https://cp2023.a4cp.org/venue.html), **August 27-31, 2023.**

The CP 2023 program will include presentations of high-quality scientific papers 
on constraints technology. In addition to the main conference program, CP 2023 
will feature 4 specialised tracks covering important topics in Constraints:

- Applications
- CP and Machine Learning
- CP and Operations Research
- Trustworthy Decision-Making

Please refer to our website for a [list of accepted papers](https://cp2023.a4cp.org/accepted_papers.html).

On the first day of the conference (Sunday August 27th, 2023), we will host a day of [workshops](https://cp2023.a4cp.org/workshops.html) and the CP [Doctoral Program](https://cp2023.a4cp.org/dp_cfp.html).

## DEI Scholarship

We are pleased to announce the CP 2023 DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) programme, which includes scholarship and mentoring to support the participation and networking of the underrepresented early-career researchers, as well as a special event during the conference to raise awareness. 

Please refer to [our website](https://cp2023.a4cp.org/cfdei.html) for information on eligibility, mentoring, the scholarship and how to apply.

**Application deadline: Monday, July 31st, 2023.**


## DEI Surveys

We would like to collect relevant diversity data about our community and activities in order to help us identify actions to improve diversity and inclusion where needed. Please help us by filling in this year's new [diversity survey](https://sunet.artologik.net/uu/Survey/626) and our [equity and inclusion survey](https://sunet.artologik.net/uu/Survey/625).

Your answers will be handled in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), https://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/data-protection-policy. The survey results will be compiled by Andreína Francisco. The results of the survey will be presented in a report both at the CP-2023 conference and on the ACP website. Results will be presented following anonymization techniques. At least ten responses are required for the results to be presented. 

**Deadline: Monday, July 31st, 2023.**
