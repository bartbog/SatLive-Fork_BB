excerpt: Two fully-funded PhD positions at KU Leuven. Join the proof logging revolution and make combinatorial optimizers deliver 100% correctness guarantees. 
---

I'm looking for two excellent PhD Researchers to join my team. One succesful candidate will focus on *proof logging*, the other candidate on *explanations* for combinatorial optimization. 

These are fully funded positions that come with a very competitive scholarship. The positions have an expected duration of 4 years. The starting date is negotiable, but ideally this would be around the summer of 2025.
 
The application deadline is March 6, 2025.

Interested? Apply [here](https://www.kuleuven.be/personeel/jobsite/jobs/60425822).      

I'm happy to answers any remaining questions about this vacancy.
