We are pleased to announce the **6th International Workshop on Counting, Sampling, and Synthesis (MCW 2025)**, taking place at the **University of Glasgow, Scotland**, on **August 11, 2025**.

MCW 2025 is an event for researchers in model counting, sampling, and automated synthesis. It covers advanced topics such as weighted and projected counters/samplers in various domains, including SAT, SMT, ASP, and CP. The workshop facilitates the exchange of cutting-edge theoretical and practical insights, focusing on innovative solver technologies and their real-world applications. Additionally, the workshop allows developers of model counters to showcase their work and share detailed competition results, encouraging discussions that bridge theory and practice.

You can showcase your best work in counting, sampling, or synthesis, whether it has been published elsewhere or not. To submit, please provide a reasonable description in PDF format and upload it to EasyChair.
