The 15th International Workshop on Pragmatics of SAT will be co-located with the
27th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability
Testing and will be held on 20th of August, 2024 in Pune, India.

The aim of the Pragmatics of SAT (PoS) workshop series is to provide a venue for
researchers working on the design and/or application of Boolean Satisfiability
(SAT) solvers and related solver technologies, including but not restricted to
Satisfiability modulo Theories (SMT), Answer Set Programming (ASP), and
Constraint Programming (CP), as well as their optimization counterparts,
to meet and share both fundamental theoretical insights into practical solvers,
as well as new implementation-level technical details about their systems.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

+ Efficient data structures
+ Techniques for debugging or certifying solvers
+ Visualization of benchmarks structure
+ Monitoring solver behavior
+ Evaluation of solvers
+ Domain specific encodings
+ Domain specific heuristics
+ Solver API
+ System and library description
+ New (successful) application of constraint-based technologies
+ New (potential) use cases of constraint-based technologies
+ Constraint solving and machine learning
+ Scaling using multi-core or distributed technology
+ Reflection on past and projection of future of applied SAT research
  (position papers and talks are both welcome)

#### Special Calls of 2024:

Besides the usual categories of **original**, **work-in-progress**, and
**presentation-only** papers, the new edition of the workshop welcomes
submissions to the following tracks:

+ **Competition track**: In addition to regular contributions, PoS 2024
  invites submissions describing tools that are submitted to any of the
  competitions associated with the main SAT conference (e.g. SAT Competition,
  MaxSAT Evaluation, Model Counting, SMT Competition, QBF Gallery, etc.).

+ **SAT fast track:** Original papers that do not make it to SAT on
  PoS-related topics will have the option of late submission to the workshop.

All submissions will be reviewed by the program committee, which will select 
a balanced program of high-quality contributions. **If a sufficient number of
original and competition track papers are accepted for the workshop (6+), a
post-proceedings in CEUR-WS Proceedings will be published.**

### Important Dates:

- Abstract submission deadline: May 13, 2024 *(all submissions except SAT fast track and competition solver descriptions)*
- Paper submission deadline: May 18, 2024
- SAT fast track submission deadline: May 27, 2024 *(no separate abstract registration is needed)*
- Competition Solver Description submission deadline: June 5, 2024 *(no separate abstract registration is needed)*
- Notification to authors: June 23, 2024
- Revised version due: July 14, 2024
- Workshop: August 20, 2024
