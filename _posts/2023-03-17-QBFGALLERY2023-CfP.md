CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

QBF Gallery 2023
 
Competition affiliated with

[SAT 2023 conference](http://satisfiability.org/SAT23/) and [QBF 2023 workshop](http://qbf23.pages.sai.jku.at/workshop)


The QBF Gallery 2023 is a non-competitive event to evaluate
the state-of-the-art in QBF solving and related technologies.

The QBF Gallery 2023 invites submissions of 
QBF solvers (PCNF as well as non-PCNF and DQBF solvers),
related tools like preprocessors as well as novel benchmark
instances to challenge current solvers (in particular, the 
publicly available solvers of the last QBFEval events). 

Based on the submissions, it will be decided which tracks will be 
organized. In contrast to competitive events, the benchmark and tool 
contributors can get involved in the organization in case they are 
interested. There will also be a joint discussion group. 

The goal of the QBFGallery is to evaluate the state of the art 
as a joint community effort, to identify interesting problems, 
and to evaluate (and maybe reconsider) current evaluation schemes.
