The workshop is an event of the RISE-MSCA project [MOSAIC](https://sites.google.com/view/mosaic-rise/home?authuser=0).


The RISE-MSCA project MOSAIC — “Modalities in Substructural Logic: Theory, Methods and Applications” aims at:

1. Putting forward a comprehensive and unifying logico-mathematical study of substructural modal logics, that is,
substructural logics with modalities.

1. Exploring the application of substructural modal logics, in particular, in the areas of Artificial
Intelligence; legal reasoning; data privacy and security; logical analysis of natural language.


MOSAIC 2023 invites submissions on a variety of topics on non-classical logics and their applications, with
special emphasis on modal substructural logics. We therefore invite contributions on relevant aspects of
non-classical logics, such as:


* Proof Theory and complexity;
* Algebraic Semantics;
* Relational frames and structural properties;
* Coalgebras, Correspondence theory;
* Fixpoint logics;
* Logics for reasoning about norms, time, preferences, uncertainty;
* Automated Deduction;
* Applications of non-classical logics.


Abstracts of contributed talks of 2-4 pages are to be prepared using the [EasyChair class style](https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors) and submitted via [Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mosaic2023)
