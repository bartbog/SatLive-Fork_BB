excerpt: ERC-Funded  PostDoc position available at KU Leuven. Join the proof logging revolution and make combinatorial optimizers deliver 100% correctness guarantees. 
---

I'm looking for talented PostDocs to join the CertiFOX project. The selected candidates will work on an exciting project in which we will bring certifying algorithms (proof logging) from low-level languages (such as SAT, where this approach is notoriously succesful) to high-level modelling languages. The grand goal we will work towards is to get end-to-end guarantees of correctness of runs of combinatorial optimization engines, all the way from human-readable input specifications to the produced answers. 

If this triggers your scientific curiousity, and you are (or want to become) a productive researcher in combinatorial optimization, have a look at the [the project webpage](https://bartbogaerts.eu/projects/CertiFOX) (under construction). 

These are fully funded positions that come with a very competitive salary or scholarship. The positions have an expected duration of 2 or 3 years for PostDocs. The starting date is negotiable, but ideally this would be around the summer of 2025.
 
The application deadline is February 6, 2025.

Interested? Apply [here](https://www.kuleuven.be/personeel/jobsite/jobs/60411819?hl=nl&lang=nl).      

I'm happy to answers any remaining questions about this vacancy.
