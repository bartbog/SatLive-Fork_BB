excerpt: The CS Department of Aalto University calls for applications for tenure-track Assistant Professorship in all areas of Computer Science.
---
The Department of Computer Science at the Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences at
Johannes Kepler University Linz invites applications for a permanent full-time position at the 
Institute for Formal Models and Verification (FMV) founded by Armin Biere.

We are looking for candidates who work in fields like

- Formal verification or synthesis of software and hardware
- Techniques and tools of formal verification 
(e.g., model checking, equivalence checking, deductive verification, symbolic execution)
- Formal models and languages 
(e.g., logic-based languages, graph transformation systems, Petri nets, process algebra)
- Automatic reasoning and decision procedures 
(e.g., SAT, SMT, first-order logic, interactive theorem proving)
- Theoretical foundations of formal verification or synthesis 
(e.g., computational logic, complexity theory, discrete structures, game theory)
- Applications of verification and synthesis like concurrent/distributed systems,
cyber-physical systems, analysis of programs and protocols, biological applications, and
future technologies like quantum computing and artificial intelligence
- Model-based testing and runtime verification
- Formal analysis and verification of artificial intelligence technologies
- Probabilistic and statistical approaches for formal reasoning
 

Informal enquiries are welcome and may be sent to `martina.seidl@jku.at`
