We are pleased to announce the Workshop on Counting, Sampling, and Synthesis (MCW 2024) as part of the SAT 2024 conference. The workshop will convene in Pune, India, on **August 20, 2024**.

MCW 2024 aims to bring together researchers in model counting, sampling, and synthesis, covering advanced topics such as weighted and projected counters/samplers across various domains, including SAT, SMT, ASP, and CP. This year, we are expanding our focus to include the role of model counters, samplers, and solvers in automated synthesis.

We invite submissions on cutting-edge theoretical and practical insights related to model counting, sampling, and synthesis. Researchers are encouraged to submit their work, whether previously published or not, for presentation as talks or posters.

## Important Dates:

- Submission Deadline: May 28, 2024
- Notification of Acceptance: June 14, 2024
- Workshop: August 20, 2024
