The Department of Computer Science (DIKU) at the University of Copenhagen invites applications for several postdoc and PhD positions in theoretical computer science and/or combinatorial optimization.
 
The postdocs and PhD students will be part of a world-leading research environment in algorithms and complexity theory. We are home to the [Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre](https://barc.ku.dk) joint with the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU), and have extensive collaborations with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and with Lund University on the Swedish side of the Oresund Bridge, as well as with our many visitors. We aim to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious, creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in algorithms and complexity theory. While our focus in on foundational research, we do have a track record of surprising algorithmic discoveries leading to major industrial applications.
 
The University of Copenhagen was founded in 1479 and is the oldest and largest university in Denmark. It is often ranked as the best university in Scandinavia and consistently as one of the top places in Europe. Within computer science, it is ranked 2nd in the European Union (post-Brexit) by ShanghaiRanking.
 
The postdoc positions are full-time research positions for an intended duration of 2 years, and the PhD positions are for a period of 3-5 years, depending on the current education level of the applicant. All our openings are for fully funded, employed positions, that come with an internationally competitive salary and include travel funding. The starting date is negotiable, but the default would be August-September 2024.
 
The application deadline for all positions is January 10, 2024. More information about [the postdoc positions](http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/openings/Postdoc-UCPH-240110.html) and for [the PhD positions](http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/openings/PhD-UCPH-240110.html) is available on those dedicated web pages. Informal enquiries are welcome and can be made to Mikkel Abrahamsen (`miab@di.ku.dk`), Jakob Nordstrom (`jn@di.ku.dk`), Rasmus Pagh (`pagh@di.ku.dk`), Srikanth Srinivasan (`srsr@di.ku.dk`), Mikkel Thorup (`mthorup@di.ku.dk`), or Amir Yehudayoff (`amye@di.ku.dk`).
